# Deployment Plan for Vercel

## Information Gathered

- Project is a fullstack app with:
  - Frontend client built with Vite (React) located in `client/`
  - Backend server code in `server/` bundled with esbuild to `dist/index.js`
- Vite build outputs static files to `dist/public`
- Package.json scripts:
  - `dev`: runs server in development mode
  - `build`: builds client and bundles server
  - `start`: runs bundled server in production mode
- vite.config.ts sets root to `client/` and build output to `dist/public`

## Plan

1. Create a `vercel.json` configuration file to specify:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Output directory for static files: `dist/public`
   - Setup for serverless functions or Node.js server for backend (depending on server adaptation)
   
2. Deployment options:
   - Use Vercel CLI:
     - Install Vercel CLI globally: `npm i -g vercel`
     - Run `vercel` in project root and follow prompts to deploy
   - Use GitHub integration:
     - Push code to GitHub
     - Connect GitHub repo to Vercel and configure build settings as above

3. Server adaptation notes:
   - Vercel supports serverless functions, so backend code in `server/index.ts` may need to be refactored into serverless functions under `api/` directory
   - Alternatively, deploy backend separately or use Vercel's Node.js server support if applicable

## Dependent Files to be Created/Edited

- `vercel.json` in project root

## Follow-up Steps

- Verify deployment on Vercel dashboard
- Test frontend and backend functionality
- Adjust server code if needed for serverless environment

Would you like me to create the `vercel.json` file with a basic configuration for your project now?
